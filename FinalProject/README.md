This program is meant to be a fantasy baseball snake draft assistant.  Its main objective is to help optimize your team live-in-draft
so as to give you an advantage against your opponents.  It does this by projecting out the next n numbers of rounds to see what the average added
value each of the top players remaining gives to your team.  The main objective of this is to help look at positional scarcity in drafts which
is hard to predict by yourself.

The executable is pretty easy to operate, as it prints out a lot of basic information about the program at the beginning, so I would recommend reading
through those materials.  Here are a few tidbits for advice for input:
1. If you are unfamiliar with fantasy baseball or fantasy sports, I would recommend saying 'Yes' for the roster construction and point system questions.
2. How long the program takes to run is contingent on how many teams are in your draft and how many rounds you want to project out.  If you choose 2 teams,
  You are able to reasonably project out over all 26 rounds.  If you choose 10 teams, a reasonable number would be around 7 rounds.
3. For each pick, make sure you type in the exact name

I made this program as a sort of an experiment to see how important positional scarcity is, and throughout development it proved to me that the
drafting players based on positions at the beginning of drafts is essentially a non-factor since the added values follow the projections list, which
to me was very surprising.  I thought that a really good pitcher would provide more added value to a team that a really good outfielder (who I thought
would be in abundance).
